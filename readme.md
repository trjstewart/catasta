#Catasta
A MEAN Stack Project Framework created with the intention of providing an adaptable platform for rapid development and deployment.

### Development Environment
This project was created and maintained using [Webstorm](www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) 2016.1 by JetBrains.

I have included the `.idea` directory in this repository for the sake of it being focused on rapid development. It already has the best configuration for its own further development.

### Getting Started
After downloading or cloning this repository, you should figure the rest out yourself.

Seriously though, I'll fill this in eventually...
